This directory has the source for the APIC-based character sleep utility
which allows applications to block for X msecs by doing a read on the
device /dev/csu with length to read set to X. 

To compile the module

    make -f Makefile.i386

To install and test the module

Create the device file (assuming we can use 61 as the major number)

Su to root then

    mknod -m 666 /dev/csu c 61 0
 
Load the module

    insmod -v ~/workdir/csu_module.o

Run the test program 

    csu_tester

You can then do a "logread" to read the messages logged by tester.
