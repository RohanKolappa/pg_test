The files in this package are used to create the xquery
The GetRequestRequestHandler includes
1. The object specific query file e.g. FileQuery.xml
2. The object list query file : ObjectListQuery.xml

When adding support for a new object, create object specific XQuery files which
1. Implement getList() which returns the entire list
2. Implement formatItem($b as element()*, $detail as xs:string)
