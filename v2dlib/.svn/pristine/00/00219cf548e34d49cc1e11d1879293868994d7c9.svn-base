The files startLoadTest.php, stopLoadTest.php and startSimulator.sh
are used to load test the StreamingServer. The php files should be 
run on a machine with php installed. startSimulator.sh can be run 
on the same machine as the StreamingSerrver but it's better to run
it on some other machine so not to load the DMS.  

(1) Copy startSimulator.sh, tx, rx, and libv2d.so to a directory
    e.g. "scripts", on the machine you want to use for simulators.
    Create a directory for image files and copy some pre-recorded 
    image files into it.  

    Set "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" to the "scripts" directory.  Then run 
    the script:

    ./startSimulator.sh DMS-IP-ADDR N IMAGE-DIR

    where DMS-IP-ADDR is the IP address of the DMS, N is the number
    of Tx and Rx simulators you want to start, and IMAGE-DIR is the
    name of the directory for image files.

(2) On DMS, start the StreamingServer.  

(3) On the php machine, run startLoadTest.php:

    php ./startTest.php DMS-IP-ADDR N

    where N is the number of streams for the test (same as the
    number of Tx and Rx simulators started in (1)).

(5) Watch the output (i.e. /var/log/messages) from the StreamingServer 
    to see if there's packet loss, and watch the CPU and memory 
    utilization of the StreamingServer

(6) Run "php ./stopLoadTest.php DMS-IP-ADDR N" on the php machine 
    to stop StreamingServer from relaying.
 
(7) The Tx and Rx simulators should exit by themselves once the
    StreamingServer stops relaying but it's safer to also do
    "killall tx; killall rx" on the simulator machine when test
    ends.
