1. xsd files

   sessionservice.xsd
   sessionservice.datamodel.xsd
   mediaroom.public.xsd (which includes other top level public xsds)
   
Note: so if we add a new request to sessionservice we may need to 
   - create a corresponding toplevel public xsd
   - include the toplevel public in the mediaroom.public.xsd
