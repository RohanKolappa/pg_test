Cdk Copying Guide

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to copy Cdk around I have some requirements that will protect me,
and possibly even you. First thing, I feel I should say that this little project
of mine has taken quite a bit 'free' time and I have put a lot of work 
into it. I do ask that if anyone asks you about Cdk, tell them where you got it
and who wrote it. If you see Cdk installed without this file on the system
somewhere, then assume the copy the person has is a 'corrupt' version. I will
not be responsible for any unfortunate results if someone else makes a personal
modification to the Cdk library. I will also not be responsible if for some
reason the installation of Cdk creates a negative effect on your machine. You
do have my word that there are no "Trojan horses", worms, or other security 
worries lurking in this code. If there are I did not put them there and you
should remove the version of Cdk you have and go get a proper copy. I hate 
virus writers as much as anyone else!

Instead of writing my own license (I'm a programmer, not a lawyer!) I'm going
to borrow the BSD public license on public software. If you do not agree to
this license then remove the Cdk distribution and we all will be happier in
the end. Here is the complete BSD public license in it's true form. I have not
made any modifications to it.

I will say one thing, Cdk is my copyright. I will continue to support any released
versions out there as long as they are in their released form. I am releasing
this into the "public" because I feel I have benefited from other people's
hard work, I'd like to chip into the pot as well. This does NOT make Cdk
public domain though. Cdk is still my copyright, and owned by me, I am merely
stating this so I don't see 40 different versions of my code floating around
with other people's names attached.

With that ugly stuff said, I will happily take any comments or questions about
Cdk. Input is more than welcomed. In fact I encourage it. Feel free to mail
me and ask questions you think the supplied documents don't cover. If I get enough
I may build a FAQ to help newcomers. (we'll see how Cdk is accepted though)

For you Perl programmers, there is a Perl5 extension to Cdk. Look at your closest
CPAN site under authors/id/GLOVER.
