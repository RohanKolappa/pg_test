Version 2.1-b06 has the following changes to 2.1-b05:

(1) Fixed a bug in get_fcd_rate() that caused frame and slice
    count to be always 0 on the "Disply Connection Information" 
    screen. (Bugzilla #1297).

(2) Swapped SOP and EOP for mouse packets in write_to_ms_fpga()
    in serverutils.c for FPGA version 162.10-0 or later. 
    (FPGA version 162.10-0 fixes Bugzilla #1286).

(3) Added code so "dreg -E 1" will make the FPGA use external
    sync and "dreg -E 0" will make the FPGA use internal sync
    (i.e., sync from the ADC).

(4) Fixed a bug in serverutils.c (process_av_req()) where we
    test for the first client by comparing server->snumbclients
    with 1. This fails if two clients set up TCP connections 
    back to back, then the server receives AV request from the
    first client (followed by AV request from the second). Since
    server->snumbclients is alreay 2 by the time the server 
    received the first AV request, we never set server multicast
    mode to that specified by the first client and everything 
    goes wrong. This can be verified with 2.1-b05 when 3 clients
    are connected on the same multicast connection and we disconnect
    the controlling client. The other 2 clients will try to reconnect
    back to back so the server never set "ismulti" and set up a  
    unicast UDP video (and/or audio) socket. The second client will
    show the multicast connection has been established but will 
    not receive video or audio data. 

Version 2.1-b07 has the following changes to 2.1-b06:
    
(5) Fixed initHorizPos(), initVertPos(), initPhaseShift(), initCoarseNoise(),
    initFineNoise(), initFrameDivider(), initPixelAdjust(), 
    initDropPhaseAdjust(), initVideoCompression() in configureVideo.c so
    if the parameter the routine is looking for is not in the config file
    we initialize the corresponding variable to its default value.

(6) Changed handle_client_mouse_read() (in clienthandler.c) and 
    write_to_ms_fpga() (in serverutils.c) to discard partial mouse 
    packets which could happen (e.g. the user was moving the mouse
    when the RX receives an SCAP with a different mouse type and the RX 
    sets the mouse type).

(7) Changed putStartSliceCode() and putStartFrameCode() in compression_utils.c
    so the codes are aligned on 4-byte boundary to allow the V2D client 
    able to display V2D splash screen.

(8) Changed find_lut_entry() (in lut_table.c) so it doesn't try to match
    the stereo setting of the detected signal to the LUT entry, also changed
    build_server_capabilities() (in serverutils.c) to send the actual
    detected stereo setting to the RX. This eliminates the need for the user 
    to specify the Stereo field in the LUT. The V2D will simply use the input 
    to the TX to configure the RX.
